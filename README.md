# boat

> Bunch of Arbitrary Tasks.
> Under the Captain's Command; the Gunner will shoot them down

- automated transport and workflow runner

## todos

- update bookofnims/.gitignore with this one
  - i think just the drawio backup and tmp extensions
- move to nirvai once ADRs stabilize
- add planned obsolescence & deprecation notice to nirvai scripts in favor of boat
  - boat should replace all bash scripts used by nirvai
- offloading installs to nimble tasks
  - perhaps even forwarding all requests to nimble tasks would simplify things
