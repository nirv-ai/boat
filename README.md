# boat

> Bunch of Arbitrary Tasks.
> Under the Captain's Command; the Gunner will shoot them down

- automated transport and workflow runner

## todos

- update bookofnims/.git{ignore,attributes} with this one
  - i think just the drawio extensions
- move to nirvai once ADRs stabilize
- add planned obsolescence & deprecation notice to nirvai scripts in favor of boat
  - boat should replace all bash scripts used by nirvai
- offloading installs to nimble tasks
  - perhaps even forwarding all requests to nimble tasks would simplify things
  - nah this TODO doesnt make sense
- i have a feeling we're going to regret using nimscript instead of just compiling to C
  - swing back to this once the ADRs stabilize and BEFORE moving repo to nirv
