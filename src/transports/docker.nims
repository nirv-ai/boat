# - dunno if we need a docker vessel
# - but somehow we need to distinguish between metal and virtualization
# - e.g. I may be on ubuntu, but I want this duty to install on vessel ( docker (vessel (alpine)))
# docker isnt a vessel, it should be considered a provider, like apt
# ^ we need an entity for providers
